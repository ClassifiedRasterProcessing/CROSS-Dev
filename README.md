# CROSS-Dev
## For active development of the CROSS tool


This repository should be used for testing changes and actively improving the function of the CROSS tool.
It is essentially the work in progress section.

Note that inputs_code has been renamed to CROSS to reflect the name as presented at the end of the semester.
Documentation should be updated to reflect this.

Active development should occur within the dev branch, with finished results committed to the testing branch.
Once those are fully tested, they should be pushed to the master tool.
